#**❌ <OBJREF (<ObjHeap\var4192953>)>.
...typically appears in ENVI (or other IDL-based applications) when there's an invalid object reference—meaning the software is trying to access a graphic or data object in memory that no longer exists or is corrupted.

#Since you're getting this when moving the crosshair over an RGB viewport, it likely relates to a corrupted or missing display layer or broken object handle in the background.

✅ FIXES AND WORKAROUNDS
Try the following steps:

1. Reset Display / Layer Stack
Go to Display → Close All Views.

Then reopen the RGB image using:

File → Open → Select your image

Choose Display → New Display Group

2. Clear Temporary Cache
Close ENVI.

Navigate to your temporary ENVI config/cache folders:

C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Temp

Or C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Roaming\ENVI\

Delete any folders like ObjHeap, .idl, or cached display data.

3. Start ENVI in Safe Mode
This disables add-ons or startup routines that could interfere.

Run from command line:

envi64 -safe
4. Recreate the RGB Composite
If the RGB file you're viewing was generated as a custom composite:

Go to Layer Manager → Remove the faulty RGB layer

Then go to Display → New RGB Image

Re-select the same bands manually (e.g., R: band 3, G: band 2, B: band 1).

5. Check for File Corruption
If the image file is corrupt or incomplete, it may trigger memory-related errors:

Re-import the image from original source (or re-download).

Try using another image—does the error still occur?

6. Patch ENVI / Reinstall if Persistent
If this bug persists across sessions and datasets:

It may be a bug in your current ENVI version (especially ENVI 5.6 or older).

Update ENVI to the latest release.

Or reinstall.**
